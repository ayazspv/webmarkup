            <p>
                My name is Ayaz. I'm Azeri-Iranian, Azeri in blood but born and grew up in Iran. I'm living in the
                Netherlands for more than 2,5 years (in December it will become 3 years).<br>I have been programming and
                making web pages for over 5 years. I started learning web design in 2017. My father was a graphical
                designer and I've learnt much from him. But he can't code at all so I took several online courses to
                learn how to code by myself. Within this course I'm willing to learn more and properly and upgrade my
                knowledge to a certain and standardized international level. <br>I'm also working as a freelancer in a
                Dutch company as a media creator, in which I make digital company as a media creator, in which I make
                digital content (sound and image) for different media goals.
